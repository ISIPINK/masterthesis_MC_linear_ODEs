In this repo I test recursive Brownian simulation (need a better name for this).

## What is  recursive Brownian simulation
Recursive Brownian simulation simulates Brownian paths with a certain
stopping criteria. This generalizes Walk on Spheres that has as stopping criteria
a time independent space boundary. In the next plot you can see how recursive Brownian simulation
simulates endpoints with stopping criteria a time-space parabola boundary.
