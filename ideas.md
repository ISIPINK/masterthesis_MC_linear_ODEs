RMC = recursive monte carlo
## examples
- RMC for ODE IVPs
- RMC for y = y'' (with different boundary conditions)

## favorites
- full Brownian motion (approx)
- basis for boundary conditions + green function = RMC solver linear PDEs
- RMC for heat equation with (smooth u(0,x) condition)
- RMC for y = y'

## propagators = basis for dirichlet
- composition property + function optimization = propagator (uniqueness?)
- filled propagators (look Walk on Rectangles)
- reject + method of images = more propagators
- propagation in jumped space
- propagation in moving space
- balancing problem  (not an idea)
- time dependent boundaries (see walk on moving spheres and linear time dependent boundaries)

## unsorted
- independence trick
- point coordination (approx)
- scale coordination (exact) 
- Ways to control the distribution of step sizes ? (see Off-centered WOS)
- multilevel = boosting?
- impossible speedup (probably isn't possible)
- smart start 
- fake boundary trick (fusing methods)
- solving over a line (difference P)
- special path dependence
- shorting quadrature

- American options
