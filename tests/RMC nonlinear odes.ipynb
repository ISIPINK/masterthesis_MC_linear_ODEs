    "# RMC for non linear ODEs\n",

    "A general approach to smooth nonlinear problems is to linearlize around the solution. <br> \n",
    "Let's look at following example:\n",
    "$$y'= y^2$$\n",
    "Say that we have a approx solution $y \\approx z$ \n",
    "$$y' = (y-z+z)^2 = (y-z)^2 - 2(y-z)z + z^2$$\n",
    "If the approx solution is sufficiently good $(y-z)^2$ is small and we can linearlize:\n",
    "$$y' \\approx - 2(y-z)z + z^2$$\n",
    "If the non linear ODE was stable under linearlization you can get better and better solutions by solving previous linear ODE.<br>\n",
    "RMC with dynamic control variate fits naturally in this linearlization, z being just the dynamic control variate. The dynamic control variate now does has influence on the convergence so needs to be updated accordantly."
