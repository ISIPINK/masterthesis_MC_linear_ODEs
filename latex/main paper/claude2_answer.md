Here are my answers to your questions:

# Content Tests

0.1. The main algorithm of the thesis is Recursive Monte Carlo (RMC) applied to linear ODEs. It involves turning the ODE into an integral equation, then estimating the recursive integral with Monte Carlo to obtain a recursive random variable equation (RRVE). Variance reduction techniques like control variates and Russian roulette are used to improve the RRVE.

0.2. The biggest limitation is that convergence analysis of RMC for general Fredholm equations is lacking. It is unclear when the methods will converge.

0.3. Coupled splitting is presented as a technique to help convergence of RMC. However, in the example shown, it did not expand the convergence domain. Its importance to the overall thesis seems limited.

0.4. Stein's paradox is mentioned briefly to illustrate that even RMSE comparisons can be counterintuitive. It does not feature significantly in the thesis.

0.5. The language is quite technical overall but generally clear when read carefully. There are some parts that could benefit from more intuitive explanations.

0.6. Some of the unclearest parts:

- The abstract could be clarified.
- The introduction and background sections jump quickly into technical details without much intuition or motivation.
- The convergence analysis is limited, making the overall behavior of the algorithms unclear.
- The coupled splitting explanation and example could be expanded.

  0.7. The Monte Carlo trapezoidal rule uses control variates based on the trapezoidal rule to eliminate bias and achieve faster convergence than standard MC integration.

  0.8. The primary motivating work introduces Walk-on-Spheres for solving PDEs, which shows high accuracy even with complex geometries.

  0.9. Russian Roulette is defined as replacing a random variable with a cheaper approximation probabilistically, in a way that preserves the expected value.

  0.10. Control variates are defined as replacing a function of a random variable with the difference of the function and its approximation, plus the expected value of the approximation.

  0.11. For the exponential of expectance, the Taylor series of the exponential is manipulated to replace the expectance powers with products of independent samples. The Bernoulli processes control the order.

  0.12. Tail recursion is reordering operations so no computation happens after the recursive call, allowing iteration without stack buildup.

  0.13. Green's functions are defined informally as kernels used to solve linear problems with linear conditions. They satisfy null conditions with a delta source term.

  0.14. The convergence behavior of the main algorithm is unclear and requires further analysis. Some examples like coupled splitting suggest limitations.

  0.15. My favorite parts:

- The interactive literature map
- The intuition and examples for recursive Monte Carlo
- The control variate RRMC example
- The connection between heat equation and Brownian motion

  0.16. Some things that seem to be missing or limited:

- More motivation/intuition in intro sections
- Convergence analysis
- Comparison to classical methods
- More explanation of coupled splitting

  0.17. No uncommon abbreviations stand out. The list of abbreviations covers the important ones.

  0.18. I don't see any clear inaccuracies. The definitions and explanations seem technically correct as far as I can tell.

  0.19. Nothing seems especially controversial. The limitations around convergence analysis are fairly openly acknowledged.

  0.20. Some suggestions:

- Add more intuition and motivation early on
- Include a convergence analysis section
- Compare performance to classical methods
- Expand the explanation and example for coupled splitting
- Clarify the abstract

# Feedback 1

1.1. Yes, the thesis generally differentiates between original contributions and prior work. The introduction summarizes the relevant literature.

1.2. The overview is reasonably good, but could benefit from more intuitive explanations in the background sections.

1.3. The conclusion is limited. More discussion of limitations, comparisons, and future work would strengthen it.

1.4. Most things are defined, but some terms like "information-based complexity" could use a more explicit definition.

1.5. I did not notice any major undefined symbols. The notation list covers the important ones.

1.6. The advantages compared to classical solvers are not discussed in detail. This could be expanded on.

1.7. Some key graphs lack sufficient explanation in the caption or text, like the coupled splitting example. But overall they are decent.

1.8. The notation seems consistent, with equations, examples, etc. numbered and referenced appropriately.

1.9. IBC and WoS appear to be introduced without definition on their first use.

# Feedback 2

2.1. The subsection on Monte Carlo integration covers the basics reasonably well.

2.2. Indefinite recursion occurs because the recursive integral is estimated stochastically, leading to a recursive random variable equation that recurses indefinitely without an end condition.

2.3. References seem appropriate from what I can tell. Key concepts are linked to papers or proofs.

2.4. Additive branching recursion is explained as the recursion branching into multiple recursive calls, exponentially increasing computation.

2.5. The Russian roulette rate is the parameter $l$ that controls the probability of applying the Russian roulette approximation.

2.6. Local truncation error is not explicitly defined. This could be added for clarity.

# Requirements

3.1. Yes, there is a title page.

3.2. Yes, a table of contents is included.

3.3. The introduction provides context and mentions the motivating work, but the problem statement could be more explicit.

3.4. The exposition generally builds logically but is very technical at times. More intuitive explanations could help. The structure with subsections is reasonably effective.

3.5. There is a Dutch summary. It appears to concisely summarize the main points.

3.6. The bibliography is present and structured well. The citations match the referenced sources.

3.7. The layout uses appropriate formatting choices for readability. Headings and structure guide the reader.

3.8. The language is technical but precise. Grammatically it appears accurate overall.

3.9. The results are presented clearly through equations, examples, graphs, etc. The analyses are logical.

3.10. There is generally good logical flow and coherence. Transitions between sections are fairly smooth.

3.11. The unique contributions around RMC for ODEs are highlighted. There is discussion of how this extends prior work.

3.12. The discussion of limitations acknowledges challenges and missing analysis. Some future work is suggested.

3.13. The writing is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon. Explanations could be clarified at times.

3.14. The thesis makes solid contributions around RMC techniques for ODEs. It is likely to be cited by others exploring similar algorithms.

In summary, the thesis covers the key requirements reasonably well. Strengthening the intuition, comparisons, convergence analysis, and limitations discussion could take it to the next level. But overall it represents significant original work that advances the field.
