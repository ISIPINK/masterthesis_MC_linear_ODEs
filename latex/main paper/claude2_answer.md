Here are my answers to the questions:

# Content tests

## 0.1. How does the main algorithm work of the thesis?

The main algorithm is Recursive Monte Carlo (RMC) applied to solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). It involves turning the equations into recursive integral equations and then estimating the recursive integrals with Monte Carlo sampling to get recursive random variable equations. Variance reduction techniques like control variates and Russian roulette are used to improve the efficiency. The key ideas are recursion in recursion for initial value problems and coupled recursion/splitting for boundary value problems.

## 0.2. What is the biggest limitation of the main algorithm of the thesis?

The biggest limitation seems to be that RMC struggles with stiff ODEs in a similar way to explicit solvers. The thesis attempts to address this with diagonal RMC but notes that it is not very effective. More work is likely needed to extend RMC to handle stiffness well.

## 0.3. How important is coupled splitting to the thesis?

Coupled splitting is one of the key techniques proposed in the thesis for solving boundary value problems with RMC while controlling the branching recursion. So it plays an important role in making RMC viable for PDEs with boundary conditions.

## 0.4. How does Stein's paradox pop up in the thesis? (see subsection on MC integration)

The thesis mentions Stein's paradox in the context of the Monte Carlo trapezoidal rule to note that it is possible to bias the estimator in a way that reduces the RMSE, even though it is an unbiased estimator. This illustrates how unbiasedness does not necessarily imply optimal efficiency.

## 0.5. Rate the language of the thesis.

The language is generally clear and precise, with some minor rough patches. Mathematical notation and terminology is used extensively, which is appropriate for the technical subject matter. The writing could be smoothed out slightly in places to enhance readability, but overall it effectively conveys the key ideas. I would rate the language as good.

## 0.6. List the 5 unclearest parts of the thesis.

- The definition of recursion in recursion. More intuition or examples would help.
- The explanation of how coupled splitting helps eliminate additive branching recursion.
- The convergence proof sketch for the Monte Carlo trapezoidal rule.
- The motivation for diagonal RMC and how it relates to implicit methods.
- The relation between RMC and stochastic gradient descent methods.

## 0.7. What is special about the Monte Carlo trapezoidal rule?

The Monte Carlo trapezoidal rule has a higher order of convergence (O(1/n^2.5)) compared to standard Monte Carlo (O(1/âˆšn)) while using roughly the same number of function evaluations. This is because the trapezoidal rule approximation acts as an effective control variate.

## 0.8. What is the main advantage of the primary motivating work?

The main motivating work by Sawhney et al. showed high accuracy for solving PDEs with complex geometries using walk on spheres methods. This inspired exploring RMC techniques for extending walk on spheres to things like ODEs and other types of PDEs.

## 0.9. How does the thesis define Russian Roulette?

Russian roulette is defined as replacing a random variable X with a probabilistically weighted approximation that is cheaper to evaluate, in a way that preserves the expected value. Bernoulli variables are used to select whether to compute X fully or use the approximation.

## 0.10. How does the thesis define control variates?

Control variates are defined as subtracting an approximation function from the integrand/recursive term and adding back its expected value. This reduces the variance of the remaining part that needs to be estimated stochastically.

## 0.11. Summarize the approach for exponential of the expectance in the unbiased non-linearity section.

The Taylor series of the exponential is manipulated by changing the coefficients to Bernoulli variables and replacing the argument with independent samples. This results in an unbiased stochastic expression for the exponential of an expected value.

## 0.12. How does the thesis define tail recursion?

Tail recursion is defined as reordering operations so that the recursive call happens last. This allows the result to be returned without retracing all the recursion steps.

## 0.13. How does the thesis define Green's functions?

Green's functions are defined as kernel functions that can be combined with integration to solve linear differential equations with linear boundary conditions. They are composed of homogeneous and particular solutions to the problem.

## 0.14. Summarize convergence behavior of the main algorithm.

For initial value problems, recursion in recursion Monte Carlo is shown to achieve O(h^1.5) convergence locally, where h is the step size. For boundary value problems, coupled splitting gives a fixed point iteration-like convergence. Overall convergence analysis is limited.

## 0.15. List your 5 favorite/intrestring parts of the thesis.

- The interactive map of the literature review.
- The visual recursive call plots to build intuition.
- The unbiased nonlinearity techniques.
- Recursion in recursion idea for emulating adaptive step size.
- Attempting coupled splitting to handle branching recursion.

## 0.16. What seem to be missing in the thesis?

- More convergence analysis, especially for PDEs/BVPs.
- Comparisons to classical methods in terms of efficiency.
- Discussion of parallelization and implementation.
- Details on handling discontinuities and nonsmoothness.
- Examples with real-world applications.

## 0.17. Any abbreviation that should/shouldn't be used?

- RMC and MC are used extensively, which is appropriate.
- RRVE for recursive random variable equation seems unnecessary.
- Some unusual abbreviations like IBC and BLUE could be defined more clearly the first time.

## 0.18. List 5 inaccuracies things in the thesis.

I did not notice any clear factual inaccuracies. The thesis seems to cover the material accurately based on my review.

## 0.19. List 5 controversial things in the thesis.

There does not seem to be anything too controversial in the thesis. A few points that could invite debate:

- Claiming the MC trapezoidal rule achieves optimal IBC rates without proof.
- Stating recursion in recursion emulates adaptive step size well without analysis.
- Using control variates in ways that destroy sparsity of linear systems.
  -Recommending Russian roulette rates without measurements or theory.
- Claiming coupled splitting converges similarly to fixed point methods without proof.

## 0.20. List 5 suggestions to improve the thesis.

- Provide more numerical experiments and convergence measurements.
- Include comparisons to other standard methods.
- Give examples of parallel implementation and performance.
- Expand the discussion and limitations section.
- Add some real-world application examples.
- Provide more intuitive explanations of key concepts.
- Improve the flow and transitions between sections.
- Add more figures for visual learners.
- Clarify how techniques extend to higher dimensions.
- Relate methods back to key literature more frequently.

The key potential advantages mentioned are parallelization due to the Monte Carlo formulation and the ability to handle problems with stochastic parameters. However, the thesis notes that in their current form, the solvers do not outperform classical methods. More work is needed to improve efficiency and robustness.

Yes, the background section introduces key Monte Carlo concepts including estimators, variance, unbiasedness, efficiency, and integration techniques.
