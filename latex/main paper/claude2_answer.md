Here are the answers in Markdown format with the questions listed before each answer:

**0.1. How does the main algorithm work of the thesis?**

The main algorithm of the thesis is Recursive Monte Carlo (RMC), which uses recursion to estimate solutions to differential equations. It works by first converting the differential equation into an integral equation using Green's functions, then turning the integral equation into a recursive random variable equation (RRVE) that can be simulated recursively using Monte Carlo techniques.

**0.2. What is the biggest limitation of the main algorithm of the thesis?**

The biggest limitation of the RMC algorithm is that it has not been rigorously analyzed for convergence, especially for challenging equations like stiff systems. The thesis mentions this limitation in the "Limitations and Future Work" section.

**0.3. How important is coupled splitting to the thesis?**

Coupled splitting is introduced as a technique to help address additive branching recursion and improve convergence of RMC for boundary value problems. While it is discussed in the thesis, it does not seem to be the most central or important technique.

**0.4. How and where does Stein's paradox pop up in the thesis?**

Stein's paradox is not explicitly mentioned in the thesis.

**0.5. Rate the language of the thesis.**

The language of the thesis seems quite technical overall. It makes frequent use of mathematical notation and terminology that may not be familiar to a general reader. However, the language is precise and clear for the intended mathematical audience.

**0.6. List the 5 unclearest parts of the thesis.**

Some of the unclearest parts of the thesis are:

- The introductory motivation and context could be expanded.
- More intuition and explanation behind some mathematical concepts could be helpful for readers less familiar with the background.
- The objectives and contributions of the thesis could be stated more directly.
- The structure could be organized more logically in some places.
- The limitations and future work section is quite brief.

**0.7. What is special about the Monte Carlo trapezoidal rule?**

The Monte Carlo trapezoidal rule uses control variates based on the trapezoidal rule to reduce the variance and achieve faster convergence compared to standard Monte Carlo integration.

**0.8. What is the main advantage of the primary motivating work?**

The primary motivating work introduces walk-on-spheres methods that achieve high accuracy for solving PDEs, even with complex geometries.

**0.9. How does the thesis define Russian Roulette?**

Russian Roulette is defined as a technique to randomly replace a random variable with a simpler approximation, reducing computational cost while introducing small, controlled increase in variance.

**0.10. How does the thesis define control variates?**

Control variates are defined as modifying an estimator by subtracting an approximate value and adding back its exact expected value. This reduces the variance.

**0.11. Summarize the approach for the second example in the unbiased non-linearity section.**

The second example in the unbiased non-linearity section handles the ODE y' = y^2 by writing it as a recursive integral equation and then using independent samples Y1, Y2 ~ Y in the recursive term to handle the non-linearity.

**0.12. How does the thesis define tail recursion?**

Tail recursion is defined as reordering operations in recursion so there are no operations after the recursive call, allowing iterative implementation.

**0.13. How does the thesis define Green's functions?**

Green's functions are defined vaguely as kernel functions used to solve linear differential equations by integrating them against source terms or boundary conditions.

**0.14. Summarize convergence behavior of the main algorithm.**

The convergence behavior of the main RMC algorithm is not rigorously analyzed. For IVPs, empirical convergence around O(h^1.5) is observed. For BVPs, arbitrary RMC is shown to diverge.

**1.1. Does the thesis differentiate between the original contributions and prior work?**

The thesis does not clearly differentiate between original contributions and prior work. The introduction mentions related work briefly but the objectives and contributions could be stated more directly.

**1.2. Does the thesis has a good overview?**

The overview is reasonably good, with background sections introducing concepts before applying them. But the motivations and goals could be clearer.

**1.3. Does the thesis has a good conclusion?**

The conclusion is very brief and could be expanded significantly. Key limitations and future work are mentioned but more discussion of achievements and open problems would help.

**1.4. Does everything gets defined in the thesis?**

Most symbols and concepts get defined, but some more verbal explanations alongside the definitions would help readability.

**1.5. Are there symbols that don't get defined in the thesis?**

Some mathematical symbols like the O() notation are used without being introduced.

**1.6. What are the advantages of the solvers in the subsetion of intial value problems compared to classical solver?**

Compared to classical solvers, the RMC IVP solvers have the advantage of being parallelizable and suitable for problems where MC methods excel like high dimensions. But rigorous convergence analysis and comparisons are lacking.

**1.7. Are the explanations for the graphs in the thesis sufficient?**

The explanations accompanying the graphs are generally sufficient, although more intuition could help understand some of the recursive behavior shown.

**2.1. Has the elementary theory of Monte Carlo been covered in the thesis?**

The subsection on Monte Carlo integration covers the basics well at an introductory level.

**2.2. In the subsection of recursive Monte Carlo why is there indefinete recursion?**

In the recursive Monte Carlo subsection, indefinite recursion arises because the recursive equation depends on itself continuously over the domain, so there is no base case to terminate the recursion.

**2.3. Does the thesis give the necessary references to concepts?**

The thesis generally provides sufficient citations when introducing concepts from the literature.

**2.4. Does additive branching gets explained clearly?**

Additive branching recursion is explained clearly with examples when it arises and techniques like Russian roulette that address it.

**2.5. What is the russian roulette rate?**

The Russian roulette rate is the parameter 'l' that controls the probability of applying Russian roulette in the examples.

**2.6. Does the local truncation error get defined?**

The local truncation error is not explicitly defined in the thesis. It gets discussed briefly for the Monte Carlo trapezoidal rule but not defined.
