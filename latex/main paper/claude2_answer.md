Here are my answers to your questions about the thesis:

# Content tests

0.1. The main algorithm of the thesis is recursive Monte Carlo (RMC). It works by converting differential equations into recursive random variable equations and then simulating them using Monte Carlo techniques.

0.2. A key limitation is that RMC does not seem to outperform classical solvers in terms of computational efficiency. More analysis and optimization is likely needed.

0.3. Coupled splitting is important for reducing variance and improving convergence when using RMC on linear Fredholm integral equations. However, it is not essential to the core RMC approach.

0.4. Stein's paradox is not directly discussed in the thesis. It relates to the idea that variance is not always the best way to compare estimators.

0.5. The language of the thesis is quite technical overall. Some parts could be explained more clearly/intuitively.

0.6. Some of the unclearest parts:

- The explanation of coupled splitting
- Introduction of recursion in recursion
- Tail recursion explanation
- Convergence analysis
- Advantages over classical solvers

  0.7. The MC trapezoidal rule achieves a higher order of convergence (O(1/n^2.5)) compared to the standard trapezoidal rule (O(1/n^2)) with minimal additional computational cost.

  0.8. The primary motivating work introduces high-accuracy MC techniques for solving PDEs, even with complex geometries.

  0.9. Russian roulette is defined as a way to probabilistically replace a random variable with a cheaper approximation to reduce computational costs.

  0.10. Control variates are defined as a way to reduce variance by subtracting out a deterministic approximation of lower order terms.

  0.11. For exponential of expectance, the thesis suggests using a Taylor series expansion of the exponential function and replacing expected values with independent samples.

  0.12. Tail recursion is defined as reordering operations in recursion so no computation happens after the recursive call, allowing iteration instead of stack-based recursion.

  0.13. Green's functions are vaguely defined as kernel functions that can convert differential equations into integral equations based on boundary/initial conditions.

  0.14. The convergence behavior of the main algorithm is not rigorously analyzed. Some examples show favorable convergence, but limitations exist.

  0.15. Favorite parts:

- Intuitive introduction to RMC
- Examples demonstrating variance reduction techniques
- Connection between heat equation and Brownian motion
- Algorithm for exponential of expectance
- Coupled recursion example

  0.16. Some things that seem to be missing:

- More intuitive explanations/visuals
- Analysis of computational complexity
- Comparisons to classical methods
- Discussion of limitations

  0.17. Abbreviations are generally defined properly on first use. No major issues.

  0.18. 5 potential inaccuracies:

- Order of convergence claims not rigorously proven
- Convergence analysis in general seems limited
- Unclear if coupled splitting actually improves convergence
- Advantages over classical methods not shown
- Definition of green functions seems imprecise

  0.19. 5 potentially controversial things:

- Using variance as only metric for estimator comparison
- Assumption of linear tradeoff between variance and computation time
- Claiming algorithm achieves optimal IBC without proof
- Convergence claims without rigorous analysis
- Lack of comparison to other methods

  0.20. 5 suggestions for improvement:

- Add more intuitive explanations and visuals
- Expand convergence analysis
- Compare performance to classical methods
- Test algorithms on more examples, with timings
- Clarify limitations and cases where approach excels/struggles
- Improve formatting for readability
- Expand discussion and conclusions sections

# Feedback 1

1.1 Yes, the thesis generally differentiates between original contributions and prior work.

1.2 The overview is decent, but could benefit from more intuitive explanations and visuals.

1.3 The conclusion is quite brief and could be expanded.

1.4 Most things are defined, but some definitions like green functions could be clearer.

1.5 No major undefined symbols that I noticed.

1.6 The advantages over classical solvers are not conclusively analyzed. This is a limitation.

1.7 The graphs seem appropriate, but more explanation of them would be helpful.

1.8 The notation seems consistent overall.

1.9 Two uncommon abbreviations used without definition:

- IBC
- BLUE

# Feedback 2

2.1 The elementary theory of Monte Carlo integration is briefly covered.

2.2 Indefinite recursion occurs because the recursive equation has no base case to terminate recursion.

2.3 Important references seem to be provided.

2.4 Additive branching refers to recursion splitting into multiple branches, causing exponential growth. This is explained.

2.5 The Russian roulette rate is the parameter $p$ in the Bernoulli trial that determines how often approximation is used.

2.6 Local truncation error is not explicitly defined.

# Requirements

3.1 Yes, there is a title page.

3.2 Yes, a table of contents is included.

3.3 The introduction provides context and states the research goals, but the problem statement could be clearer.

3.4 The argumentation is reasonably detailed, but clearer/more intuitive explanations in parts would help. Subsections are used effectively for organization.

3.5 Yes, a concise Dutch summary is included.

3.6 The bibliography section is present and structured well. Citation style seems accurate.

3.7 The layout is designed for readability. Headings and formatting aid comprehension.

3.8 The language is technical. Clarity could be improved in some areas but is decent overall. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation look accurate.

3.9 Results are presented clearly with graphs. Analysis is generally appropriate but could be expanded.

3.10 There is logical flow between sections. Transitions are concise but present.

3.11 The unique contributions are stated, though limitations exist. The gap filled is not entirely clear.

3.12 The discussion of implications is brief. Practical applications and future work are mentioned but could be expanded on.

3.13 The writing is concise but veers into jargon at times. Explanations of concepts are mostly understandable.

3.14 The thesis makes contributions, but significance is unclear without comparisons. Citation potential seems reasonable.

In summary, the thesis meets most requirements reasonably well but could be strengthened in certain areas like clearer explanations, more thorough analysis, expanded conclusions, and added comparisons to other techniques. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of my assessment.
