This thesis explores unbiased Monte Carlo
methods for solving linear
ordinary differential equations with a vision towards
partial differential equations.
The proposed algorithms capitalize on the appropriate
combination of Monte Carlo techniques.
These Monte Carlo techniques get introduced with examples
and code.
