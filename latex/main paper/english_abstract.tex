Unbiased algorithms for solving linear initial value problems have received limited attention.
To address this, we propose unbiased Recursive Monte Carlo methods for solving
linear initial value problems and linear Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. Motivated
by understanding randomized parallel complexity and downstream applications to partial differential
equations, these methods are developed.

Previously only biased methods were known to achieve optimal convergence rates for nonlinear
initial value problems.
The proposed RRMC method, an unbiased algorithm for linear initial value problems,
together with control variates is conjectured to be order optimal with high
probability for corresponding smoothness classes.

Parallel to this, the main Poisson algorithm is proposed, generalizing the algorithm in \cite{acebron_monte_2016},
which is simple and forward implementable. The main Poisson algorithm is applied
to the semi-discretized heat equation demonstrating a path resampling technique, that provides
a novel perspective on the Walk on Spheres method, with potential for alternative generalizations.

The proposed methods broadens what is thought to be possible with unbiased algorithms for
solving linear initial value problems, paving the way for further research in this area.
