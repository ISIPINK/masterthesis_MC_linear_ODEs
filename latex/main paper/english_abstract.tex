This thesis introduces recursive Monte Carlo
for solving linear initial value problems with a vision towards
partial differential equations.
Further proposing $3$ new methods:
RRMC an unbiased method for linear initial value problems
that has similar convergence behavior in step size or function evaluations to traditional methods,
coupled splitting an unbiased technique for linear Fredholm integral equations of the
second kind that has similar convergence behavior to fix-point methods
and finally an unbiased path resampling method similar to walk on spheres applied
to recursive Monte Carlo of an IVP obtained by semi-discretizing the heat equation.
