Unbiased algorithms for solving linear initial value problems have received limited attention.
To address this, unbiased Recursive Monte Carlo methods are proposed for solving linear initial
value problems and linear Fredholm integral equations of the second kind.

Motivated by understanding randomized parallel complexity and downstream applications
to partial differential equations (PDEs), these methods are developed.

The RRMC method, an unbiased algorithm for linear initial value problems, is conjectured
to be order optimal with high probability when combined with control variates for corresponding smoothness classes.

The main Poisson algorithm, a generalization of the algorithm used by Acebron et al. (2016), can be implemented in a forward fashion, making it simpler and easier to use. This forward implementation enables the creation of other algorithms that operate in the same direction of time.

The main Poisson algorithm is applied to the semi-discretized heat equation, demonstrating a path resampling technique, which is a generalization of the walk-on-spheres method.

Unbiased algorithms for solving linear initial value problems have received limited attention, whereas most research on randomized algorithms has focused on biased methods for nonlinear initial value problems. This is addressed here by proposing unbiased Recursive Monte Carlo methods for solving linear initial value problems and linear Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. Motivated by understanding randomized parallel complexity and downstream applications to partial differential equations, these methods are developed.

Previously only biased methods were known to achieve optimal convergence rates for nonlinear initial value problems which has primarily theoretical significance.
The proposed RRMC method, an unbiased algorithm for linear initial value problems, together with control variates is conjectured to be order optimal with high probability for corresponding smoothness classes.

Parallel to this, the main Poisson algorithm is proposed, which generalizes aceborns algorithm, can be implemented in a forward fashion. The main Poisson algorithm is applied to the semi-discretized heat equation demonstrating a path resampling technique, that provides a novel perspective on the walk-on-spheres method, with potential for alternative generalizations.

The proposed methods broadens the understanding of what is possible with unbiased algorithms for solving linear initial value problems, paving the way for further research in this area.
